Biased Sampling
---------------

Let
w_i >= 0       be the weight of object i
Y_i \in [0, 1] be the target attribute

The numbers of the observations belonging to classes 0 and 1 may be chosen arbitrarily. 
In this case the estimation of the probability of class 1 will be biased w.r.t. the general population. 
To fix this, p, the prior probability of class 1, must be set. 
Then w_i and Y_i are changed to w'_i and Y'_i as follows:

YPos_i := k_1 Y_i
YNeg_i := k_0 (1 - Y_i)
w'_i := w_i (YPos_i + YNeg_i)
Y'_i := YPos_i / (YPos_i + YNeg_i)

where 
W := sum_i w_i
k_1 = W p       / \sum_i w_i Y_i         - Multiplicity factor of class 1
k_0 = W (1 - p) / \sum_i w_i (1 - Y_i)   - Multiplicity factor of class 0

which ensures that
\sum_i w'_i = W
\sum_i w'_i Y'_i       / W = p
\sum_i w'_i (1 - Y'_i) / W = 1 - p

NB: make sure p != 0 or 1
