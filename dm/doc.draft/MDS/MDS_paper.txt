MDS paper
=========


To do:
  beta-lactamases: 3 rays plus clouds in the middle
  build a NJ for M.tb., compare with the MDS plot
  re-do all images
    .dm-files: use correct distance scale
    mds
    TIFF
    JPG

  Reviewers: recommend 4



MYG:
  attach data
  provide software
  script to reproduce the results

random tree:
  ~/work/mds_paper/tree32/random.json
  clusters, rays 
  MDS, canonical projection

Ideas: 
  NJ tree is better than an MDS tree ??
  distances which do not requires multiple sequence alignment
  "MLE tree" -> "globally optimal LS tree"
  methods on MDS space vs. on D^2
    size: n*q vs. n^2
      e.g., K-means
  noise removal by selecting a small q ??!
  

MDS of a tree: clustering: K-means with a cluster radius as a parameter: clade identification ??
  
        
X = [X1 X2 ...] => S(X) = \sum_i S(X_i)
  Normalize S(X_i) to have the same variance


Show novelty

Discussion
  Direct MDS (approximate D^2): needs to know q    
  d' = d + c is a distance [Gower, Legendre 1986] 
    Drawbacks:
      non-continuity of function
      d = d'_mds - c  may be negative
      implies that all principal submatrices of size 2 x 2 are p.s.d.

Problems:
  Compute the MDS of a tree using the tree
  MDS of a tree structure: clustering into co-originating rays ??
  lambda_1 vs. k in d^k ??


MDS properties ??
  horizontal transfer => 
    negative eigenvalue 
  proteins: PCs match different domains (ex.: blaSHV) 
    

MDS-inferred tree arcs !??
  projection on the vector: clade center - others' center
    inter-center distance^2 <= arc (path ?) length
                                                                                                                                                                  


 
"horse shoe" effect

"robust" ??

NNJ trees:
  non-robust
    proof ??

                          
canonical analysis:
  see: Aivazian
  find tree structure:
    make small clusters (max. number of clusters n = 10 ?)
    find halves with large canonical analysis eigenvalues (threshold = 50 ?) with possible eliminating "incertae sedis" objects
      time = O(2^(n-1))
    check that halves are either contained in other halves or non-overlapping
    build a tree
    do the above recursively to the leaves of this tree
  show that for random halves lamda ~ 0
    
eigenvalues of a real non-symmetric matrix ?
